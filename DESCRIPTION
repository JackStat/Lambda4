Description: Currently the package includes 5 functions.  Three of which are
    different methods of calculating Guttman's lambda4 coefficient.  One allows
    the user to select the item splits. The remaining two are new methods to
    calculate reliability. Both are based on a combination of Cronbach's alpha
    and Maximal-type reliability coefficients but use different maximization
    procedures.  Lastly, lambda3 (Cronbach's alpha) is included for
    convenience.
